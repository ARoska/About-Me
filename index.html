            <h2>About me:</h2>

            <p>I am a future programmer, currently studying at Code Fellows in Seattle, WA.  I grew up and have lived my entire life in Washington.  I am passionate about gaming, Japanese animation and culture, and of course coding!  I am aiming to break into the coding industry because I have always believed in the old adage from Confucious: "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life"</p>

            <h2>Education:</h2>
            
            <p>I am a current student at Code Fellows.  Prior to my start as a future coder I spent a few years at ITT-Technical Institute in Everett, WA.  While there I was studying for my Bachelor's in Network Service Administration.  Unfortunately the school closed a mere quarter before I would have received my degree.  I didn't let that get me down though!  I look at the time I spent there and the things I learned and know that I can apply them to my future career, and since the school was closed involuntarily I didn't even have to pay for all of that knowledge!</p>
            
            <h2>My work background:</h2>

            <p>I come from a retail background.  I spent over 10 years working for Fred Meyer (a Kroger company) both in Operations and in the Electronics department, and a couple of years at a small online retailer called Fully Loaded Electronics.  The locations I have worked at are:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Fully Loaded Electronics in Mill Creek, WA</li>
                <li>Fred Meyer (Electronics) in Snohomish, WA</li>
                <li>Fred Meyer (Electronics and Operations) in Lynnwood, WA</li>
                <li>Fred Meyer (Operations) in Monroe, WA</li>
            </ul>    
            
            <p>Most of that time was spent in a leadership or management role, and I aquired many useful skills pertaining to leading all different manner or people.  I have worked with people from every walk of life, and with groups ranging in size from 3 direct reports to 50+.</p>
